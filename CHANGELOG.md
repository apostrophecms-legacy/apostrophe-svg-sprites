## 1.0.17

The "Manage Sprites" list view now displays the sprites again when used with recent versions of Apostrophe.

## 1.0.16

update of existing sprite now works properly, eslint configured and passing, unit test written and passing, refactored lib/import.js to conform to our standard pattern for requiring part of the implementation of a module from another file
